This is IBM Batch2 Group 8 project

ABSTRACT OF USED CAR PRICE PREDICTION MODEL USING LINEAR REGRESSION


Problems-
1.	Which variables are crucial in determining the price of a car?
2.	What may be the price of a car considering the crucial parameters?
3.	What is the relation of different parameters with our target parameter that is the price of the car?
4.	What machine learning algorithms are considerable?


Deliverables-

1.To build a model for predicting the price of resell cars using linear Regression machine learning algorithm.

2.	Considerable number of reliable attributes is to be consider to uplift the accuracy of the model.

3.	Steps that we considered 
      
      I.	Understanding and exploitation of data
      
      II.	Cleaning of Data
      
      III.	Building of Model and evaluation
